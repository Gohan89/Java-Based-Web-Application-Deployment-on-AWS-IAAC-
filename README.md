**Project Title: Java-Based Web Application Deployment on AWS with Flexible Infrastructure**

![Layout](https://github.com/Gohan89/Java-Based-Web-Application-Deployment-on-AWS-IAAC-/blob/main/Layout.png)


**Description:**
This repository contains the code and configuration files for deploying a three-tier Java-based web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. The project utilizes various AWS services such as EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, S3, Route 53, and IAM to ensure flexibility, scalability, and reliability of the deployed application. The infrastructure is designed to operate on a pay-as-you-go model, optimizing costs while meeting performance demands.

**1. Overview:**
The project aims to demonstrate how to set up a robust infrastructure on AWS for deploying and scaling Java-based web applications. It includes scripts and configuration files for deploying application, database, messaging, and caching services on separate EC2 instances. The deployment is orchestrated using Infrastructure as Code (IAAC) principles and automation tools provided by AWS.

**2. Prerequisites:**
- An AWS account with necessary permissions to create and manage EC2 instances, ELB, Auto Scaling, S3, Route 53, and IAM resources.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and concepts.
- Java development environment set up on local machine.

**3. Installation:**
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have the necessary AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
- Install any required dependencies mentioned in the project's documentation.

**4. Configuration:**
- Update the configuration files with your AWS credentials and specific settings as per your requirements.
- Review and modify the IAM policies, security group rules, and other configurations to align with your security and compliance standards.
- Customize application properties files to establish connections with backend services.

**5. Usage:**
- Follow the steps outlined in the README.md file to deploy the application on AWS.
- Test the deployed application to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
- Monitor the application's performance and scale the infrastructure as needed using AWS management console or CLI.
